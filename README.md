Horizontal Geodetic Network Adjustment with Error Ellipse Analysis ‚Äì MATLAB Implementation
This repository presents a comprehensive MATLAB code for 2D (horizontal) network adjustment of a geodetic control network using the least squares method, enriched with precision analysis and error ellipse computation for each estimated station.

 Key Features
‚úÖ Observation Processing and Accuracy Estimation
‚Ä¢	Calculates the mean observational accuracy based on the nominal precision of the theodolite (total station) and the field measurements.
‚Ä¢	Constructs the variance-covariance matrix of the observations and derives the weight matrix accordingly.
‚úÖ Network Adjustment and Statistical Analysis
‚Ä¢	Performs least squares adjustment to estimate the unknown station coordinates.
‚Ä¢	Determines the degrees of freedom of the adjustment.
‚Ä¢	Computes the residuals (corrections) of observations and estimates the accuracy of adjusted variables (e.g., coordinates, directions).
‚Ä¢	Evaluates the posterior variance factor and performs a statistical test on it to verify the reliability of the network adjustment.
‚úÖ Error Ellipses and Precision Visualization
‚Ä¢	Computes and draws error ellipses for each network station based on the covariance matrix of adjusted coordinates.
‚Ä¢	Calculates the area of each error ellipse, providing a quantitative representation of positional precision.
‚Ä¢	Notes that larger elongation of an ellipse along a specific direction indicates greater uncertainty in that direction.
‚úÖ Visualization
‚Ä¢	Graphically represents the survey network, including stations, connections, and associated error ellipses using MATLAB plotting functions.

üóÇ Input & Assumptions
‚Ä¢	Input includes observed distances and azimuths between stations for a defined 2D network.
‚Ä¢	Each dataset ends with a given azimuth (bearing) for one edge to resolve orientation.
‚Ä¢	Station 1 is fixed with known coordinates (x‚ÇÅ = 1000, y‚ÇÅ = 1000) and serves as the control point.
